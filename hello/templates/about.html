					<h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Two years ago, at the University of Chicago, I was in the midst of pulling an all-nighter finishing my Master's Thesis on Supranationalism's effects on Intra-Community Trade,
          when it occurred to me, that while trade data is entirely quantifiable and quantitative, bilateal relations are exclusively qualitative and had thus far eluded quantification.
          <br><br> After completeing my Master's I began to sketch out how bilateral relations could be quantified. It seemed evident that any quantification would entail a survey of whom the head
          of state/government met with, how much trade flowed between each country, and how similar they were. As I began to collect data to build out the formula, it became evident that this
          project would involve a lot of data and would need o be constantly recalculated. As at this point I had zero background in computing and didn't know anyone who knw how to code, I put the project on hold.
          <br><br>
          However, in the Spring of 2016, I grew disenchanted with the degrees of Bureaucracy I was ensnared in at the UN-plus the pay was abysmal. So I decided to shoot for th stars and build a platform that could
          analyze bilateral relations and display its content fo th world to consume. If no one gives a dam, well at least I learned Python/Javascript/Html/SQL/CSS and can now do full stack development.
          <br><br>
          So, if you are reading this, it means you probably do give a hoot about the quantification of bilateral relations. In which case, I emplore you to explore our website, dig deep into the data, and consult with the consultants.
          Everything is free to use, but if you like what QuantPolitik has done and are interested in working with us further, get in touch!
