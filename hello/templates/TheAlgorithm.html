                    International Relations, or simply IR, are the study and analysis of relationships between States.
                    These bilateral (country-to-country) relationships are not particularly dissimilar from the interpersonal
                    relationships that two individuals may experience.  Wherein, family (same language), marriage (alliances),
                    friendship (governmental leadership interaction), clubs (IMF/G20), work associates (trade flows), and
                    shared neighborhoods (OAS).  If there is someone who you’re not friends with, related to, romantically
                    involved, live near, work with, or even associate with, it would be hard to call that person a friend,
                    or someone with whom you’re generally concerned about.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Bilateral relations are the same way;  if two countries are far away from one another,
                    and they don’t trade together, their leaders don’t meet with one another, they both have sharply
                    different views on contentious issues like democracy and human rights, and one is especially wealthy and big,
                    while the other is poor and small, would you expect them to be best friends? Of course not! Which is why
                    Eritrea, a tiny, extremely poor country, with a horrendous human rights record and limited strategic
                    value preforms miserably on the QuantPolitik ranking. While a country like the United Kingdom; a nation
                    whose language we borrowed, trade with prolifically, constantly interact with at the highest echelons of
                    government, and who posses tremendous instruments of power (nukes, UNSC seat), in addition to a government
                    that respects liberty/human rights and allows visa free access to American citizens, would be expected to be
                    considered a best friend.

              <p>QuantPolitik approaches international bilateral relations in the same way any person would
                approach the question of who are my friends? We first break down the question of what is friendship
                on the international level? And then we evaluate how each country performs in each area.
                <br>
                <br>
                At the end of the day, the way we judge who are friends are, time spent together/shared

                      QuantPolitik is the first attempt to quantify international relations.
                        Since the birth of the nation state diplomacy has always been characterized in qualitative terms:
                        “Jim Mattis Says U.S. Is ‘Shoulder to Shoulder’ With Japan”, “Bush Tries to Mend Relations With Mexico”,
                         “Better Relations With Cuba”,  “New Tensions With Iran”.  All are NY Times headlines from the past few
                         years and all describe bilateral relationships in qualitative terms. But imagine we spoke about the
                         economy or science in the same way? “Financiers believe the Dow has risen today”,
                         “Scientists take darkening mood as sign climate change is accelerating.”
                        Why can’t international relations escape qualitative descriptions and be subject to precise
                        measurement in the same way virtually everything else in modern world is? Well this is the fist
                        attempt to do so.

                <p><!--[-->During the last week of March 2017, many top officials in the US government had commented on
                  Bashar al-Assad and that he was unlikely to go. Meanwhile, Trump had heaped praise on Russia, and
                  Russia had returned the favor. Anyone who sought to predict the future of US-Syrian relations or
                  US-Russian relations would have predicted that ties were destined to grow closer. However, on
                  April 4th, Assad launched chemical weapons against Khan Shaykhun, and three days later Trump ordered
                  59 missiles launched against the Shayrat airfield in Syria, leading to strained ties with Russia and
                  the end of each side’s overly gushing rhetoric. US officials also shifted from discussing a future
                  with Assad to stating that he had to go.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Assad’s decision to use chemical weapons against his own people could not be predicted,
                  no matter how fancy the math, nor could the responses of any government be predicted either.
                  However, the missiles launched could be reflected in data and the absence of a Putin-Trump summit
                  can also be captured in the nonappearance of any meetings between the two. While, the supposed
                  rapprochement between the US-Russia at the expense of China (as was assumed in January 2017), will not
                  be reflected, rather the rapprochement between the US-China at the expense of Russia will be.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  QuantPolitik does not seek to engage in parlor games of how bilateral relations will unfurl,
                  rather we seek to assess what trends-as reflected in the data-have occurred and what are the consequences.

                        Since this project seeks to express qualitative information quantitatively,
                        it could readily be described as a formula. An algorithm differs from a formula in that an
                        algorithm describes a set of instructions to be followed. Both may take you to the same place,
                        the answer, yet one (a formula) implies a high correlation with fact or assurance. Whereas an
                        algorithm has more of a lexical “best approach” or “best yet” kind of a feel. The formula implies a
                        solution that works while the algorithm implies it's the best we got so far. I am therefore
                        acknowledging that the terminology of a formula, while more definitionally applicable, has
                        unearned connotations that ultimately would subtract from this project which is more a recipe;
                        throw x-related data together, brew/analyze daily, pour/quantify as a QP Score.

                      as up-to-date, nor reflective as any data scientist would like. In addition, some will certainly
                      see this entire project as an exercise in futility, since International Relations is “inherently
                      unquantifiable.” These and other concerns have most assuredly been at the forefront of consideration
                      during the construction of this platform. I’ll be the first to admit that there are significant
                      areas for improvement. However, this is only the first version of the first attempt by anyone to
                      quantify bilateral relations, and that any and all critiques are more than welcome.
                      Any oversights, I’ll be happy to correct, and any additions I’ll be happy to make room for.
                      As this is a continuing project, currently undertaken by just myself, what is displayed on
                      this site is solely, the best attempt thus far to quantify bilateral relations.
